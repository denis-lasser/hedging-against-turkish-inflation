    "The ongoing economic crisis in Türkiye has been characterized by high\n",
    "inflation, the depreciation of the Turkish Lira (TRY), rising borrowing\n",
    "costs, and increasing loan defaults. The underlying causes of the crisis\n",
    "can be attributed to several factors, including political instability,\n",
    "global economic pressures, and the implementation of unconventional\n",
    "economic policies. Since 2018, inflation has been a persistent issue,\n",
    "partly due to fluctuations in global oil prices and exchange rates, with\n",
    "Turkey's inflation rate ranking among the highest in emerging markets. The effectiveness of inflation-targeting policies\n",
    "has been limited by both internal shocks, such as political events and\n",
    "the COVID-19 pandemic, and external factors, such as rising global\n",
    "inflation. Furthermore, the Turkish\n",
    "government's policy of maintaining low interest rates to stimulate\n",
    "growth, despite the conventional theory that raising interest rates\n",
    "should reduce inflation, has contributed significantly to the current\n",
    "economic challenges. Nevertheless, interest\n",
    "rates have been raised significantly. As of November 2024, the most\n",
    "recent rate hike was in March 2024, when the central bank increased the\n",
    "policy rate by 5 percentage points to 50\\% as the year-on-year inflation\n",
    "reached 75\\%. Since then, the rate has remained\n",
    "unchanged as the central bank has been committed to fighting high\n",
    "inflation and stabilising the Turkish lira. As of October 2024,\n",
    "year-on-year inflation stands at 48\\%. This study aims\n",
    "to analyze which assets, as well as which portfolio of assets, would\n",
    "have been the most effective in hedging against Turkish inflation."

    "This study examines the effectiveness of various assets as hedges against Turkish inflation, using monthly data from January 2018 to September 2024. The monthly frequency was selected for the following\n",
    "reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The use of monthly data allows for the smoothing of short-term fluctuations. This facilitates the identification of more coherent relationships between inflation and asset returns.\n",
    "2. Key economic indicators, including inflation rates, are typically reported on a monthly basis. By aligning asset data with this frequency, the analysis maintains consistency and relevance in relation to reported inflation rates.\n",
    "3. The influence of short-term trading anomalies, seasonal effects and temporary market shocks on weekly data must be acknowledged. Monthly data minimizes the impact of these irregularities, thereby providing a more stable basis for the analysis of assets as potential inflation hedges."

    "\n",
    "This study includes a range of assets to capture different potential\n",
    "hedging mechanisms against inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following indices were sourced from Bloomberg:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TUCXEFYY Index**: This index tracks the Turkish CPI (Consumer\n",
    "  Price Index) excluding categories such as food, energy, alcohol, and\n",
    "  tobacco. This represents the core inflation rate and excludes the most\n",
    "  volatile components of the CPI, given that the aforementioned\n",
    "  categories are often subject to short-term price fluctuations due to\n",
    "  external factors. In the context of hedging against inflation, it is\n",
    "  more meaningful to focus on core inflation, as short-term fluctuations\n",
    "  in volatile categories can distort the true underlying inflation rate.\n",
    "  Therefore, this index serves as the benchmark and allows for direct\n",
    "  comparison of the other assets against inflation.\n",
    "2. **XU100 Index** (BIST 100): This index comprises the 100 largest\n",
    "  companies traded at the Borsa Istanbul and provides insight into the\n",
    "  response of Turkish stocks to inflation.\n",
    "3. **GTTRY10YR** (10-Year Turkish Government Bond): Long-term\n",
    "  government bonds, such as the 10-year Turkish government bond, are\n",
    "  traditionally considered low-risk investments. Including this bond in\n",
    "  the analysis allows for an assessment of the inflation risk premium\n",
    "  embedded in Turkish government debt.\n",
    "4. **XAU**: This index represents the price of one ounce of gold\n",
    "  quoted in US Dollars (USD). Gold is often seen as a traditional hedge\n",
    "  against inflation due to its historical retention of value. Analyzing\n",
    "  gold prices in USD allows for an assessment of gold's ability to\n",
    "  preserve purchasing power during periods of high inflation in Türkiye,\n",
    "  while avoiding the potential distortions caused by exchange rate\n",
    "  volatility.\n",
    "4. **XBT BGN**: Bitcoin is included in the analysis as an\n",
    "  alternative inflation hedge, with prices analyzed in USD. Analyzing\n",
    "  Bitcoin in USD focuses on its performance as a global inflation hedge,\n",
    "  independent of potential distortions caused by exchange rate\n",
    "  volatility. This approach provides insights into Bitcoin's ability to\n",
    "  preserve purchasing power and its relevance in the context of Turkish\n",
    "  inflation.\n",
    "5. **USGG10YR Index**: The 10-year US Government bond yield was used as the risk-free rate in the Markowitz Optimization. This rate serves as a benchmark for risk-free returns and providess a baseline to evaluate the performance of other assets and calculate excess returns in the portfolio construction.\n",

    "nationwide residential property price change in Türkiye. Real estate is\n",
    "often considered a strong inflation hedge, as property values and rental\n",

    "Using the average real return of the 10-year US Treasury (-20.87\\%), the portfolio is heavily allocated to Turkish government bonds (57.76\\%) and Turkish real estate (30.21\\%), with minimal allocations to gold (8.40\\%) and bitcoin (0.15\\%). This allocation reflects a strategy to minimize risk while achieving a modest expected portfolio return (1.34\\%) and relatively low volatility (19.77\\%).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, using the median real return (-13.71\\%) shifts the allocation dramatically, with a complete exclusion of Turkish government bonds (0.00\\%) and a heavier weighting in gold (24.67\\%) and Turkish real estate (67.15\\%). This allocation results in a much higher expected return (22.05\\%), but at the cost of much higher volatility (41.25\\%).\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences in portfolio allocations and outcomes illustrate that the choice between the mean and median real risk-free rate can profoundly affect optimization results, particularly in environments with volatile inflation and significant outliers. The mean risk-free rate, which is more sensitive to extreme values, drives a conservative allocation with lower returns and risk. The median risk-free rate, which is robust to outliers, leads to a more aggressive allocation that prioritizes higher expected returns at the expense of greater volatility. These results show the importance of conducting robustness checks, especially when inflation or other economic conditions vary significantly, as assumptions about the risk-free rate directly impact the portfolio's risk-return profile.\n",
