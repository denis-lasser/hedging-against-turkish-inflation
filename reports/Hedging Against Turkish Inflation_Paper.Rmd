# Introduction
The ongoing economic crisis in Türkiye has been characterized by high inflation, the depreciation of the Turkish Lira (TRY), rising borrowing costs, and increasing loan defaults. The underlying causes of the crisis can be attributed to several factors, including political instability, global economic pressures, and the implementation of unconventional economic policies. Since 2018, inflation has been a persistent issue, partly due to fluctuations in global oil prices and exchange rates, with Turkey's inflation rate ranking among the highest in emerging markets (Yilmazkuday, 2022). The effectiveness of inflation-targeting policies has been limited by both internal shocks, such as political events and the COVID-19 pandemic, and external factors, such as rising global inflation (Nazlioglu et al., 2024). Furthermore, the Turkish government's policy of maintaining low interest rates to stimulate growth, despite the conventional theory that raising interest rates should reduce inflation, has contributed significantly to the current economic challenges (Kantur & Özcan, 2022). Nevertheless, interest rates have been raised significantly. As of November 2024, the most recent rate hike was in March 2024, when the central bank increased the policy rate by 5 percentage points to 50% as the year-on-year inflation reached 75% (Bloomberg, 2024). Since then, the rate has remained unchanged as the central bank has been committed to fighting high inflation and stabilising the Turkish lira. As of October 2024, year-on-year inflation stands at 48% (Bloomberg, 2024).
This study aims to analyze which assets, as well as which portfolio of assets, would have been the most effective in hedging against Turkish inflation.

# Methodology
This study examines the effectiveness of various assets as hedges against Turkish inflation, using monthly data from January 2018 to September 2024. The monthly frequency was selected for the following reasons:

1. The use of monthly data allows for the smoothing of short-term fluctuations. This facilitates the identification of more coherent relationships between inflation and asset returns. 
2. Key economic indicators, including inflation rates, are typically reported on a monthly basis. By aligning asset data with this frequency, the analysis maintains consistency and relevance in relation to reported inflation rates.
3. The influence of short-term trading anomalies, seasonal effects and temporary market shocks on weekly data must be acknowledged. Monthly data minimizes the impact of these irregularities, thereby providing a more stable basis for the analysis of assets as potential inflation hedges.

## Data Collection
This study includes a range of assets to capture different potential hedging mechanisms against inflation. 

Following indices were sourced from Bloomberg:

- **TUCXEFYY Index**: This index tracks the Turkish CPI (Consumer Price Index) excluding categories such as food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco. This represents the core inflation rate and excludes the most volatile components of the CPI, given that the aforementioned categories are often subject to short-term price fluctuations due to external factors. In the context of hedging against inflation, it is more meaningful to focus on core inflation, as short-term fluctuations in volatile categories can distort the true underlying inflation rate. Therefore, this index serves as the benchmark and allows for direct comparison of the other assets against inflation. 

- **XU100 Index** (BIST 100): This index comprises the 100 largest companies traded at the Borsa Istanbul and provides insight into the response of Turkish stocks to inflation.

- **GTTRY10YR** (10-Year Turkish Government Bond):  Long-term government bonds, such as the 10-year Turkish government bond, are traditionally considered low-risk investments. Including this bond in the analysis allows for an assessment of the inflation risk premium embedded in Turkish government debt.

- **XAU**: This index represents the price of one ounce of gold quoted in US Dollars (USD).  Gold is often seen as a traditional hedge against inflation due to its historical retention of value. Analyzing gold prices in USD allows for an assessment of gold’s ability to preserve purchasing power during periods of high inflation in Türkiye, while avoiding the potential distortions caused by exchange rate volatility.

- **XBT BGN**: Bitcoin is included in the analysis as an alternative inflation hedge, with prices analyzed in USD. Analyzing Bitcoin in USD focuses on its performance as a global inflation hedge, independent of potential distortions caused by exchange rate volatility. This approach provides insights into Bitcoin’s ability to preserve purchasing power and its relevance in the context of Turkish inflation.

Furthermore, the house price index data was obtained from the Turkish Central Bank’s EVDS database (https://evds2.tcmb.gov.tr/index.php?/evds/portlet/KSAktmjeowo%3D/en). Specifically, the **TP KFE TR-1** series was used, which tracks nationwide residential property price change in Türkiye. Real estate is often considered a strong inflation hedge, as property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. This index allows an analysis of the effectiveness of the real estate sector in preserving purchasing power during inflationary periods.

## Analysis Techniques
The analysis consists of two main steps. First, the effectiveness of each individual asset in providing a hedge is evaluated. Subsequently, an optimal hedging portfolio is determined.

The first step is to calculate the **excess return** for each asset relative to the Turkish inflation rate.

This calculation differs depending on whether the asset is denominated in TRY or USD:

- Asset denominated in TRY:

\[
\text{Excess Return}= \text{Nominal Return} - \text{Inflation Rate}
\]

Excess return is calculated as the asset's return minus the Turkish inflation rate over the same period. This straightforward calculation reflects the direct impact of inflation on TRY-denominated assets.

- Asset denominated in USD: 

\[
\text{Excess Return} = \frac{1 + \text{Nominal Return}}{1 + \text{Inflation Rate}} - 1
\]

In this case, Turkish inflation is used to adjust the nominal return. Real returns for USD-denominated assets, such as gold and Bitcoin, are calculated using Turkish inflation rates to assess their effectiveness in preserving purchasing power in Türkiye. While nominal returns in USD account for global factors, real returns adjusted for Turkish inflation provide a clearer measure of an asset's ability to hedge against the specific inflationary pressures experienced in Türkiye.

This first step evaluates each asset's ability to preserve purchasing power. Assets with consistently positive excess returns are considered to have stronger hedging characteristics, as they maintain or increase purchasing power above inflation. This initial analysis provides a basis for assessing each asset's stand-alone ability to serve as an inflation hedge.

Building on the individual asset analysis, the next step applies **Markowitz portfolio optimization** to construct an optimal portfolio that maximizes the hedging effectiveness against Turkish inflation. Markowitz optimization, also referred to as **Mean-Variance Optimization**, determines the portfolio composition that achieves the highest return for a given level of risk / the lowest risk for a given return. In the context of this study, the aim is to construct a portfolio that minimizes inflation risk while providing stable excess returns. By balancing a range of assets,this optimization creates a portfolio that preserves purchasing power against inflation more effectively than any individual asset alone.

The process involves the following calculations:

1. **Portfolio Return**:
   \[
   \text{Portfolio Return} = R_p = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i R_i
   \]

where:

- \( R_p \): Portfolio return
- \( w_i \): Weight of asset \(i\) in the portfolio
- \( R_i \): Return of asset \(i\)
- \( n \): Number of assets in the portfolio

2. **Portfolio Variance**:
   \[
   \text{Portfolio Variance} = \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
   \]
   
where:

- \( \sigma_p^2 \): Portfolio variance (measure of risk)
- \( w_i, w_j \): Weights of assets \(i\) and \(j\) in the portfolio
- \( \sigma_{ij} \): Covariance between the returns of assets \(i\) and \(j\)
- \( \sigma_{ii} \) or \( \sigma_i^2 \): Variance of asset \(i\) (case when \( i = j \)

3. **Minimizing Portfolio Risk**:
   \[
   \min_{w} \, \sigma_p^2 \quad \text{subject to:} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i R_i = R_{\text{target}}, \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1, \quad w_i \geq 0
   \]
   
where:

- \( \min_{w} \, \sigma_p^2 \): The objective is to minimize the portfolio variance
- \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i R_i = R_{\text{target}} \): The portfolio must achieve a specified target return (\( R_{\text{target}} \))
- \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1 \): The sum of portfolio weights must equal 1, this ensures that the portfolio is fully invested
- \( w_i \geq 0 \): Weights must be non-negative, assuming no short-selling

Solving the optimization problem generates the efficient frontier, which represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest return for a given level of risk. The efficient frontier is derived by varying $R_{\text{target}}$ and solving the optimization problem for each level of return.
